# Reinforcement Learning

All the algorithms I implemented while reading Introduction to Reinforcement Learning by Sutton and Barto.

*There's a separate ReadMe for each topic*

1. [Introduction to Reinforcement Learning by Sutton and Barto](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf)
2. [David Silver's amazing lectures](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=david+silver+rl)
3. [Stanford CS234](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOSOPzutgyCTapiGlY2Nd8u) 
(CS234 and David silver often use different notations, it would be better to follow just one of them in the beginning)
