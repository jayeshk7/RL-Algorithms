# Reinforcement Learning

All the algorithms I implemented (using Python3 and NumPy) while reading Introduction to Reinforcement Learning by Sutton and Barto.<br/>
*There's a separate ReadMe for each topic*


High Level structure of the repo :
1. [Bandits](https://github.com/jayeshk7/RL-Algorithms/tree/master/1.%20Bandits)
    - Epsilon-greedy
    - Optimistic initial value
    - Softmax exploration
2. [Dynamic Programming methods](https://github.com/jayeshk7/RL-Algorithms/tree/master/2.%20DP%20methods)
    - Policy iteration
    - Value iteration
3. [Model free methods](https://github.com/jayeshk7/RL-Algorithms/tree/master/3.%20Model%20free%20methods)
    - [Monte Carlo control](https://github.com/jayeshk7/RL-Algorithms/tree/master/3.%20Model%20free%20methods/Monte%20Carlo) 
        - On-Policy Monte Carlo
        - Off-policy Monte Carlo using Importance Sampling (incomplete)
    - [Temporal-difference methods](https://github.com/jayeshk7/RL-Algorithms/tree/master/3.%20Model%20free%20methods/TD%20Learning)

### Resources 
CS234 and David silver often use different notations, it would be better to follow just one of them in the beginning (I prefer David Silver's lectures)
1. [Introduction to Reinforcement Learning by Sutton and Barto](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf)
2. [David Silver's amazing lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ)
3. [Stanford CS234](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOSOPzutgyCTapiGlY2Nd8u)
