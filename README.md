# Reinforcement Learning

This repository is a compilation of all the topics I studied and algorithms I implemented while studying this weird but awesome field. 

*There's a separate detailed ReadMe for each topic*

### What's in this repo?
This has my (hopefully working) implementations of all the algorithms I studied. There's mainly two sections here :
1. Classical RL
    - [Bandits]
    - [Dynamic programming methods]
    - [Model free methods]
    This part is where I learnt the important reinforcement learning concepts. All the implementations are done using python and numpy. 
2. Deep RL
    - [DQN variants]
        - [Deep Q-Networks] (DQN)
        - [Double DQN]
        - [Dueling DQN]
        - [DRQN] (Deep Recurrent Q-Networks)
    - [Vanilla policy gradients]
        - [REINFORCE]
        - [Advantage actor-critic]
    - [Deterministic policy gradients]
        - [Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients] (DDPG)
        - [Twin Delayed DDPG] (TD3)

### Resources 
1. Introduction to Reinforcement Learning by Sutton and Barto 
2. David Silver's amazing lectures
3. Stanford CS234 
These are the main resources that I used for studying.
