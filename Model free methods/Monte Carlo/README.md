# Monte Carlo solutions to Model-free RL

This folder has my solutions to the blackjack and gridworld environment using Monte Carlo methods.

You need to have OpenAI gym installed in your machine, it already has the blackjack environment. You can refer blackjack's source code [here](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/toy_text/blackjack.py) for any clarifications. For the Gridworld environment souce code, visit this [github page](https://github.com/podondra/gym-gridworlds).

**Algorithms implemented**:
- [x] On-policy MC evaluation and control (Blackjack environment)
- [ ] Off-policy MC evaluation and control (Gridworld environment)

**Resources**:
1. Chapter 5 of the book : Introduction to Reinforcement Learning by Sutton and Barto
2. David Silver's amazing lectures on YouTube
I have also added comments in my code. Hopefully, it made the code easy to follow.


Feel free to raise an issue/PR if you find something wrong with the code!
