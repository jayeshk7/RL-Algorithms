### Some key papers in Deep Q-learning

This list is not exhaustive, and also completely borrowed from [here](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/keypapers.html). I have also attatched my notes on each paper, you can go through it if you don't feel like reading the entire paper.

1. Playing atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602))([notes](https://hackmd.io/@TEQ3v-u1T6yDU7m-urS36A/B1bBgwulP))
2. Deep Recurrent Q-Learning for POMDPs ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.06527))([notes](https://hackmd.io/@TEQ3v-u1T6yDU7m-urS36A/ByhoPbdXw))
3. Dueling network architectures for Deep RL ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06581))([notes](https://hackmd.io/@TEQ3v-u1T6yDU7m-urS36A/ryVbki1QP))
